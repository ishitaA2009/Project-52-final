                    <ol>
                        <li>Teddy bears got their name from the story that Teddy Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear cub while on a hunting trip in 1902.</li>
                        <li>The first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete Steiff. She created a soft plush with movable arms and legs and a friendly face after taking her nephew to the zoo in 1903.</li>
                        <li>The world's smallest stitched teddy bear is a mere 0.29 inches tall! It was created by South African artist Cheryl Moss who is known for her minuscule work.</li>
                        <li>The official term for a teddy bear collector is an ‘arctophile’.</li>
                        <li>The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first use of the term teddy bear to 1906.</li>

                        <li>They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate.</li>
                        <li>The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus.</li>
                        <li>Females make a much quieter sound by flicking their wings</li>
                        <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes</li>
